A preview is available at hem<a name="1"></a>.bredband.net/b200596/ru/telling_time_in_russian.html

I haven't verified that the sentences are correct as this is work in progress. If you do not speak Russian you'll find a description in English if you click the help link (blue question mark) on the page.
